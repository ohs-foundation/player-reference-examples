/**
 * Process-wide "the local FHIR data changed" tick that screens observe to re-query. Both app writes
 * (questionnaire extraction) and completed syncs bump it: sync downloads write straight to the
 * engine database, bypassing the repository's own write path, so without this signal a register
 * would stay stale until the next app-side edit. WorkManager and `BGProcessingTask` run in the app
 * process, so this singleton reaches the foreground collectors from a background sync too.
