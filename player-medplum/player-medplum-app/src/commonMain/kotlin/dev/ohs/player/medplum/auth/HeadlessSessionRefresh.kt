/**
 * Loads the persisted session and refreshes an expired access token, so a headless/background sync
 * (Android WorkManager, iOS `BGProcessingTask`) hands [FhirBearerAuthenticator] a valid Bearer
 * token even when the UI bootstrap that normally hydrates [SessionRepository] never ran.
 *
 * Builds its own [AuthService] over the baked [OAuthConfig.Default] and the singleton
 * [SessionRepository] rather than resolving one from Koin: iOS background launches don't call
 * `initKoin`, so nothing is registered there. Offline-safe — a transient/offline failure keeps the
 * stored session (see [AuthService.ensureFreshSession]); it only returns null when there is no
 * usable session at all, in which case the sync will simply 401 and be retried later.
