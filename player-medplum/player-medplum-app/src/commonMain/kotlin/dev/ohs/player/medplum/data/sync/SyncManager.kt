 * This app's single sync seam. Scheduling is inherently platform-specific — WorkManager on Android,

 * its own implementation (`WorkManagerSyncManager`, `ForegroundSyncManager`, `IosSyncManager`).
 * Routing every sync operation through one interface also keeps the ViewModels unit-testable
 * against a fake: the engine's `runSync` is a top-level extension over a global singleton, so there
 * is no seam to fake without it.
