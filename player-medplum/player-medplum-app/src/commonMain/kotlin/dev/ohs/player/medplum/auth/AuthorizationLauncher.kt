 * - Android: Chrome Custom Tabs + a custom-scheme deep link.
 * - iOS: ASWebAuthenticationSession (returns the callback URL directly).
 * - Desktop: a localhost loopback HTTP server + the system browser.
 * - Web: a full-page redirect; the callback is read on the next page load via
 *   [consumeRedirectCallback].
 *
 * [redirectUri] is the platform-correct value and must be registered at the identity provider. It
